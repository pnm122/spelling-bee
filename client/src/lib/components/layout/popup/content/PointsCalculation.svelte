  By default, the number of points you earn from a word is equal to the length of the word. For example,
  finding the word "HELLO" will earn you 5 points. If you use a hint and find a word that begins with that hint, you lose 1 point. 
  Finally, if you turn on word previews, all subsequent points are reduced by 20%.
