  By default, the number of points you earn from a word is equal to the length of the word. For example,
  finding the word "HELLO" will earn you 5 points. If you use a hint to find a word, you earn 1 point for each
  letter the hint had not already given you. Finally, if you turn on word previews, all subsequent points are
  reduced by 20%.
